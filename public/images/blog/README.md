# Blog Images Directory

This directory is for storing blog post cover images and other related media.

To use the sample blog functionality, add the following image files here:
- `react-cover.jpg`
- `styling-cover.jpg`
- `api-cover.jpg`
- `retro-ui-cover.jpg`

Or update the image paths in the `blog-utils.js` file to match your actual image locations.
